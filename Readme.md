# Overview
This C++ program uses a dynamic array of integers to represent a data type for massive numbers. You can use this to perform basic arithmetic with large numbers.
## Features
This program makes use of many object oriented design principles. Such as: <br>
-- C++ Operator Overloads (+,-,*,<,>,<=,>=,==,!=,>>, and <<) <br>
-- Multiple Constructors (Default, Conversion Constructors) <br>
-- Deep Copy Constructor <br>
-- Assignment Operator <br>
-- Pre-fix and Post-fix Operators
## How to Use 
1. Compile the .cpp and driver files with "g++ testMain.cpp myint.cpp" <br>
2. Use the a.out file with the input or you can supply your own numbers. i.e. "./a.out < input.txt" or "./a.out", respectively.

### Notes
The expected output file is what you should get if you run the testDriver with the input file. Actual is what I get when I run it with the input.
